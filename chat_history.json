You want a luxurious and minimalistic app called \"Aura\" that reminds users daily that they are rich. The app should use a black and gold color scheme and display the message \"You Are Rich Today,\" the current date, a day streak counter, the infinity symbol for wealth level, and the phrase \"Because you deserve the reminder.\"\n\nHere's a plan to implement this:\n\n1.  **Modify the Home Screen:**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to display the required information.\n    *   Implement the \"You Are Rich Today\" message.\n    *   Display the current date.\n    *   Implement a day streak counter that increments each day the app is opened. This will likely require using `AsyncStorage` to persist the streak.\n    *   Display the infinity symbol (wealth level).\n    *   Add the \"Because you deserve the reminder\" message at the bottom.\n    *   Style the elements with black and gold colors to create a luxurious and minimalistic look.\n\n2.  **Update App Theme:**\n    *   Modify the theme to use black and gold as the primary colors. This might involve changing the `_layout.tsx` file or a dedicated theme file (if one exists).\n\n3.  **Remove Modal Demos:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is no longer needed.\n\nI will now instruct the coding agent to implement these changes.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, please remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-05T14:58:19.238098"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a luxurious \"Aura\" app that reminds users they are rich every day.
