If it's not running correctly, the app won't load.\n\n    *   **Solution:** Ensure the Metro bundler is running. If it's not, try running `npm start`, `yarn start`, or `expo start` in your project directory. If it's already running, try restarting it by pressing `c` in the terminal where it's running, or by closing the terminal and restarting the process.\n\n2.  **Cache Problems:** Sometimes, cached files can interfere with the preview.\n\n    *   **Solution:** Clear the Expo cache by running `expo start -c` or `expo r -c`. This forces a fresh start and clears any cached modules.\n\n3.  **Dependency Issues:** Incompatible or missing dependencies can prevent the app from building correctly.\n\n    *   **Solution:** Make sure all your dependencies are installed and compatible. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are present. Check for any version conflicts or compatibility issues between your packages.\n\n4.  **Simulator/Device Problems:** The simulator or device you're using might be experiencing issues.\n\n    *   **Solution:** Try restarting the simulator or device. If you're using a physical device, ensure it's properly connected and configured for development.\n\n5.  **Code Errors:** Syntax errors or runtime exceptions in your code can prevent the app from loading.\n\n    *   **Solution:** Check your code for any errors. Review the terminal output or the browser console for error messages. Pay close attention to the files mentioned in the error messages (e.g., `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`, `components/FloatingTabBar.tsx`).\n\n6.  **Expo Go App:** Ensure you have the Expo Go app installed on your simulator or physical device. This app is necessary to run Expo projects.\n\n7.  **Firewall/Proxy Issues:** Sometimes, network configurations can block the connection between your development machine and the simulator/device.\n\n    *   **Solution:** Check your firewall and proxy settings to ensure they're not blocking connections on the ports used by Expo.\n\nTo help me diagnose the issue more effectively, could you please provide the following information:\n\n*   Are there any error messages in the terminal where you started the Expo development server?\n*   Are you using a simulator or a physical device?\n*   Have you made any recent changes to your project's dependencies?\n*   Can you share the output of the `expo doctor` command?

Now, let's proceed with the implementation.\n\n**1. Centering the Text:**\n\nI need to identify the styles applied to the \"DAY STREAK\" and \"WEALTH LEVEL\" text elements. Assuming they are within `View` components, I'll add `justifyContent: 'center'` and `alignItems: 'center'` to the style of those `View` components.\n\n**2. Matching the Text Color:**\n\nI will modify the `styles/commonStyles.ts` file to include a `gold` color and then apply this color to all the `Text` components in `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\n**3. App Store Availability:**\n\nTo ensure your app is available on the Apple App Store, you'll need to:\n\n*   Have an Apple Developer account.\n*   Configure your app for iOS in Expo.\n*   Build your app for iOS using EAS Build.\n*   Submit your app to the App Store for review.\n\nSince I cannot directly modify files, I will provide the code snippets that you need to change.\n\n**app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx**\n\n```tsx\n// Add these imports\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\nimport AsyncStorage from \"@react-native-async-storage/async-storage\";\nimport { useFonts, PlayfairDisplay_400Regular, PlayfairDisplay_700Bold } from \"@expo-google-fonts/playfair-display\";\nimport { StyleSheet, View, Text, Platform, Animated, Image } from \"react-native\";\nimport { CormorantGaramond_300Light, CormorantGaramond_400Regular } from \"@expo-google-fonts/cormorant-garamond\";\nimport { LinearGradient } from \"expo-linear-gradient\";\nimport { useTheme } from \"@react-navigation/native\";\nimport { colors } from \"../../styles/commonStyles\"; // Import colors\n\n//... inside the HomeScreen component\n\n   <View style={[styles.streakContainer, {backgroundColor: theme.colors.backgroundAlt}]}>\n        <Text style={[styles.streakText, { color: colors.gold }]}>DAY STREAK</Text>\n        <Text style={[styles.streakValue, { color: colors.gold }]}>{dayStreak}</Text>\n    </View>\n\n    <View style={[styles.wealthContainer, {backgroundColor: theme.colors.backgroundAlt}]}>\n        <Text style={[styles.wealthText, { color: colors.gold }]}>WEALTH LEVEL</Text>\n        <Text style={[styles.wealthValue, { color: colors.gold }]}>\u221e</Text>\n    </View>\n\n//... inside the styles variable\n\nstreakContainer: {\n    width: '40%',\n    padding: 10,\n    borderRadius: 10,\n    alignItems: 'center', // Add this\n    justifyContent: 'center', // Add this\n  },\n  wealthContainer: {\n    width: '40%',\n    padding: 10,\n    borderRadius: 10,\n    alignItems: 'center', // Add this\n    justifyContent: 'center', // Add this\n  },\n  streakText: {\n    fontSize: 16,\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n    textAlign: 'center',\n  },\n  wealthText: {\n    fontSize: 16,\n    fontWeight: 'bold',\n    textAlign: 'center',\n  },\n  streakValue: {\n    fontSize: 20,\n    textAlign: 'center',\n  },\n  wealthValue: {\n    fontSize: 20,\n    textAlign: 'center',\n  },\n```\n\n**styles/commonStyles.ts**\n\n```ts\nexport const colors = {\n  primary: '#162456',    // Material Blue\n  secondary: '#193cb8',  // Darker Blue\n  accent: '#64B5F6',     // Light Blue\n  background: '#101824',  // Keeping dark background\n  backgroundAlt: '#162133',  // Keeping dark background\n  text: '#e3e3e3',       // Keeping light text\n  grey: '#90CAF9',       // Light Blue Grey\n  card: '#193cb8',       // Keeping dark card background\n  gold: '#FFD700',       // Add gold color\n};\n```\n\nRemember to install the required dependencies if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage @expo-google-fonts/playfair-display @expo-google-fonts/cormorant-garamond\n```\n\nThese changes will center the text in the boxes and change the text color to gold.
